            <p>Authors: <i>Florence Clavaud and Pauline Charbonnier (Lab of the Archives nationales of France)</i>.</p>
            <p>Date of this version: June, 10<sup>th</sup> 2025.</p>

            <p>This demonstrator was created as part of the development work, between August 2021
              and June 2022, of a new version of the open source visual SPARQL query editor <a
                href="https://sparnatural.eu">Sparnatural</a>, for which the French Ministry of Culture,
              the National Library of France, and the National Archives of France have partnered to contract
              with Sparna, Sparnatural’s lead developer.</p>
            <p>This demonstrator, which uses the current version of Sparnatural, is the result of an exploratory work on the transition from
              archival metadata to data graphs, following the projects of qualitative proof of concept <a
                href="https://piaaf.demo/logilab.fr">PIAAF</a> (released in February 2018) and development of the <a
                href="https://github.com/ArchivesNationalesFR/Referentiels">RiC-O Converter
                software</a> (version 1.0 released in April 2020). The main challenge of the project was to <b>provide users with a
                relevant and accessible research interface to explore an archival
                metadata graph of significant size, which exploits its nature.</b>

            <h2>Objectives</h2>
            <p>The work to develop the current version of Sparnatural was carried out by the project
              team — i.e. representatives of the three partner institutions and Sparna — with the
              aim of providing answers to the following general questions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>How to value a knowledge graph as a knowledge graph? <br />(and not behind a faceted
                search engine or clickable navigation links)</li>
              <li>How to promote exploratory user interactions (test/error) to discover the
                data?</li>
              <li>How to reconcile generic conceptual models with the specific points of view of the end users?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>From the point of view of the National Archives, the demonstrator was to be used in
              particular:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>to <b>test the evolutions of Sparnatural</b> and thereby contribute to the
                development work;</li>
              <li>to <b>set up a very first web application making it possible to query and consult a significant part
                  of the institution’s archival metadata</b>, converted to RDF/RiC-O.</li>
              
            </ul>
            <p>In doing so, the objectives were also:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>to demonstrate that large-scale semantization of “classic” archival metadata is
                possible, and that this opens up new search opportunities for users;</li>
              <li>to show what such an operation allows to learn about these metadata;</li>
              <li>to build a methodology and acquire skills on the implementation of Sparnatural,
                which was likely to be used in other projects.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This work is part of an overall strategy for the evolution of National Archives’ metadata and information system towards better quality, more accessible metadata and linked entity graphs.</p>

              <h2>Quick project history</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Sparna set up an RDF  database (using <a href="https://www.ontotext.com/products/graphdb/graphdb-free/">GraphDB Free</a> software) on the <a href="https://www.huma-num.fr/about-us/">French Very Large Research Infrastructure (TGIR) Huma-Num of CNRS</a>
                service grid, and a GitHub repository to store the demonstrator code (summer 2021);
                the database has been provisionally filled with RDF/RiC-O data already available at
                the National Archives.</li>
              <li>Start of development of Sparnatural version 2 (August 2021), in agile mode.</li>
              <li>Workshops between Sparna and the Archives Lab for getting started with the Sparnatural configuration method.</li>
              <li>Selection of the metadata set, conversion to RDF/RiC-O data (see below <a
                  href="#processus">The production process of the datagraph</a>) and import of the
                metadata set into the RDF database; first additional data processing (Lab, autumn
                2021).</li>
              <li>First Sparnatural configurations by the Lab in autumn 2021 (with the help of
                Sparna).</li>
              <li>Following the developments of Sparnatural v2, a first version of the demonstrators
                was set up, which was tested in user workshops. Two workshops were held in November
                2021, bringing together about 20 persons of various backgrounds (archivists,
                researchers, genealogists, DH engineers, etc.), during which the participants, after
                a presentation of the project and the Sparnatural tool, were able to test the
                interface. During these workshops, the project team collected their feedback and the needs raised by these tests, then presented the developments planned for Sparnatural.</li>
              <li>Progressive integration by Sparna of Sparnatural developments into the
                demonstrator’s repository on GitHub; testing and implementation of these new features by
                the Lab in the demonstrator’s search interface.</li>
              <li>Second metadata conversion to RDF/RiC-O, and consolidation of search interface
                configurations (May-June 2022).</li>
              <li>Third metadata conversion to RDF/RiC-O (in order to fixe some inconsistencies in the triples generated from the EAD files), and a few updates in the search interfaces (August 2022).</li>

            <p>The metadata of the National Archives of France are today mainly:</p>

              <li>more than 30,000 finding aids (conforming to the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/ead/ead2002a.html">XML/EAD 2002 DTD</a>),</li>
              <li>more than 15,400 authority records (conforming to the <a href="https://eac.staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/">XML/EAC-CPF schema</a>) on archival creators,</li>
              <li>vocabularies used to index these files,</li>
            </ul>
            <p>to describe about 375 linear km of paper archives of all types, not including

                virtuelle</a>(online catalog) allows users to search all of these metadata.</p>
            <p>Given this important volume, in the absence of a semantic application such as <a
                href="https://data.bnf.fr/">data.bnf.fr</a> and given the human and financial
              resources available, a subset of these metadata had to be selected to feed the

              responsible for them (the Department of Minutier Central des Notaires de Paris at the
              Direction des Fonds — DMC), for several reasons:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>they form <b>a coherent whole</b> (in all, these are the archives of 122 notarial
                offices, produced and preserved continuously since the end of the 15<sup>th</sup> to the beginning of the

              <li><b>their description is rich</b> (about 1.6 million acts have already been
                analyzed) and is constantly enriched, <b>while presenting overall the classic

              <li>they describe <b>documents that are widely consulted by various types of
                  audiences</b>; the fonds placed under the responsibility of the DMC
                accounted for 26 % of the communications of the National Archives, all sites combined, 
                in 2019, according to <a
                  href="https://francearchives.fr/fr/file/9d09efcdaad5d47250fb010d7d8c8d3dcab796b5/Rapport_enquete_notaire_Fullenbaum%20Lenfant_2020.pdf"
                  >the survey report</a> entitled <i>Presentation of resources in notarial archives
                  and their valorisation on the websites of the Departmental and National

              <li><b>archives of the same nature are kept in each of the departmental archives services</b>. The survey report quoted above indirectly gives a general overview of these fonds.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We therefore chose to work on <b>the authority records of archival creators (in
                XML/EAC-CPF) and finding aids (in XML/EAD 2002) relating to the archives of the
                first 40 Paris notarial offices</b> (out of the 122 kept in the National Archives,
              i.e. about one third of the offices). The relevant XML/EAC-CPF and EAD 2002 files were
              selected from a complete export of validated XML files, carried out on 11 March 2022
              by the Information Systems Department of the National Archives. The selection was made
              by following the links established between the first forty EAC-CPF records of
              notarial offices and, on the one hand, the notaries’ records, on the other hand, the finding aids. This operation produced a corpus including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>the 40 records describing notarial offices I to XL</b> (and the LIII office
                record, in which one of the notaries of office XV also worked between 1961 and
                1973);</li>
              <li><b>the 1079 records describing the notaries who worked in these forty
                offices</b>;</li>
              <li><b>the 1577 archival finding aids describing the archives of these offices</b> (32
                % of the 4,902 existing finding aids validated in March 2022 for the DMC), including
                933 digitized registers; 899 of these finding aids describe acts or mentions of an
                act (based on the results of a SPARQL query executed on the obtained RDF graph).

            <p>To this set we have added <b>the records (on persons and organizations which are the subjects of
                documents) and vocabularies (types of documents, subjects, activities, places of
                Paris...) used in these records and finding aids to index them</b>. These records and
              vocabularies are published and available in a public <a
                href="https://github.com/ArchivesNationalesFR/Referentiels">repository of the
                National Archives on GitHub</a>. Please note that the versions of the creator
              records in this repository are dated March 2022.</p>
            <p>As part of the project, <b>these metadata sets were somewhat enriched</b>. Thereby, for
              the notaries from offices I and II, the chronological relations between successive notaries were added
              to the EAC-CPF records, paving the way for possible future work. Some new entries
              (such as ‘notarial register’, ‘list of acts’ and ‘mention of an act’) and definitions
              (e.g. definitions assigned to notarial deeds or notarial minutes) have also
              been added to the document types vocabulary, with the agreement of the DMC. The
              purpose of these additions was not to immediately enrich the source EAD files, but to
              make these additions possible afterwards, while adopting rigorous definitions that we could immediately use to construct the RDF graph.</p>

            <h3>The data graph production process</h3>
            <p>The selected metadata have been converted into linked data graphs, compliant to the new <a href="https://www.ica.org/sites/default/files/ric-cm-02_july2021_0.pdf"
                >Records in Contexts Conceptual Model (RiC-CM)</a> and its technical transposition, the <a
                href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology">Records in Contexts-Ontology</a> (RiC-O, version 0.2,
              published in February 2021).</p>
            <p>The conversion was carried out twice. The first iteration was performed in November
              2021, the second in May 2022, after learning various lessons from the first one and
              from the initial configuration work on the demonstrator.</p>
            <p><b>To convert the XML/EAD and XML/EAC-CPF files, we used the open source software <a
                  href="https://github.com/ArchivesNationalesFR/rico-converter">RiC-O
                Converter</a></b>, developed for the National Archives in 2019 and available on
              GitHub since April 2020. RiC-O Converter produces RDF files compliant with RiC-O 0.1.
                <b>The resulting files were then made compliant with RiC-O 0.2 and slightly enriched
                or modified by specific scripts written by the Lab.</b> Among the enrichments and changes
              made let us mention: the propagation of the provenance relation from the description of each fonds  to the description of all the archival resources included in this fonds, the categorization (with the <a
                href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#hasDocumentaryFormType"
                >rico:hasDocumentaryFormType</a> property and the document type vocabulary) of
              instances of <a href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#RecordResource"
                >rico:RecordResource</a> that can be identified as registers, lists of acts and
              mentions of acts, and the replacement of association relations between notarial
              offices and notaries by more precise membership relations.<br /><b>The vocabularies
                and records used to index EAD and EAC-CPF files have been converted using dedicated
                scripts</b>, written and used by the Lab.<br /> Finally, once imported into the
              RDF database chosen for the demonstrator (currently, an instance of the <a href="https://www.ontotext.com/products/graphdb/download/">GraphDB Standard</a> software, configured in a very simple way), <b>the data graph has been further
                enriched</b>, in order to create classes specific to notarial archives and to
              “populate” these classes by inference. The screenshot below shows an example: these
              are the SPARQL queries that were used to add the <i>demoanonto:Repertoire</i> class to
              the RDF database and to create the instances of this class. In other words, an
              ontology extending RiC-O 0.2 was produced and implemented. Even if this work was not
              essential, it has greatly facilitated the design of the demonstrator’s configurations and
              also made it possible to optimize its operation by reducing the execution time of
              certain queries.</p>

            <h3>Statistical elements concerning the resulting RDF graph</h3>
            <p>The graph obtained currently has about <b>57,9 million RDF triples</b>, including
              about 37 million inferred triples. We can therefore already estimate that the RDF
              graph resulting from the semantization of all metadata from the notarial archives of the
              National Archives would amount to about 170 million triples. In addition, let us recall that the approximately 4900 finding aids of the DMC make up 16 % of the total
              number of 30,000 finding aids. Even if simplistic extrapolations are to be avoided, especially since these EAD files are among the most indexed and precise in the National
              Archives, it is now proven that <b>semantizing all of the institution’s XML metadata
                would produce an extremely massive dataset</b>.</p>
            <p><b>This dataset is the first large-scale semantization operation (in RDF compliant with RiC-O 0.2) carried out by the National Archives (and
              in France as far as we know) of “classic” archival metadata.</b> It should be
              noted that another less massive dataset was also released in December 2021 (in a
              public <a href="https://github.com/ArchivesNationalesFR/ALEGORIA-datasets">repository
                on GitHub</a>) and that it is also accessible via the <a
                href="http://data.alegoria-project.fr/sparql/">SPARQL endpoint</a> of the
             ALEGORIA project).</p>
            <p>In this dataset, are used, among the components defined in RiC-O 0.2:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>34 classes (entity categories) out of 106 (48 with inferred triples);</li>
              <li>25 <i>datatype properties</i> (relations whose target is a string) out of 62 (28
                counting inferred triples);</li>
              <li>79 <i>object properties</i> (relations whose target is an entity) out of 423 (162 with inferred
                triples).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>SPARQL queries executed directly in the SPARQL endpoint of the RDF database, in order
              to go beyond the limit of 1000 results set for the Sparnatural interface, give <b>the
                following counts for the main categories of objects described in the graph</b>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li> 72,665 groups of records (fonds, series, bundles, clients files, etc.);</li>
              <li><b>400,570 notarial acts</b> (described to date) within the bundles;</li>
              <li><b>104,383 mentions of acts</b> recorded in the registers;</li>
              <li>3135 registers;</li>
              <li><b>13,127 lists of acts within the registers</b>, including 11,670 digitized
                lists;</li>
              <li>629,246 persons (including 3,213 persons with an IRI);</li>
              <li>530 organizations (including 528 with an IRI);</li>
              <li>15,559 places (including 15,463 with an IRI).</li>
            </ul>
           
            <p>As explained below, if the quantities found for notarial acts, mentions of acts and
              lists of acts are to be regarded as a good approximation (given the fairly
              reliable reasoning that we used to generate the data), the numbers found for persons and
              registers are not reliable and can only be considered orders of magnitude. However, these
              statistics, on their own, show in our opinion the interest of the technologies used
              (since it is currently impossible for an end-user to obtain them via the Salle des
              inventaires virtuelle, and it is not easy to calculate them for a professional
              competent in the field of XML technologies). <b>They show above all, if it is still
                necessary to prove it, the very richness of these archival holdings.</b></p>

            <h3>Choices and design methods</h3>
            <p>Several Sparnatural configuration options are possible: configuration via a Google
              spreadsheet or an OWL ontology (see the <a
                href="https://docs.sparnatural.eu/index.html">documentation</a>). The Lab chose to
              configure the demonstrator via an ontology, with the help of Sparna, and used <a
                href="https://protege.stanford.edu/">Protégé</a>, a free software, to edit the
              ontology.</p>
            <img src="assets/img/classe_protege.png" style="width:1000px;"
              alt="Example of Sparnatural class edition in Protégé" />
            <p>
              <i>Sparnatural class edition in Protégé.</i>
            </p>
            <p>The configuration ontology of a Sparnatural search interface imports and uses
              components defined in two generic ontologies included in the source code of the
                software.<br /><b>The aim is to specify an ontological model for research and its
                correspondence with the classes and properties of the domain ontology.</b><br />
              This approach makes it possible to retain certain categories of objects or
              relationships rather than others that are considered secondary to search, to specify
              new ones to group several existing components in order to simplify the exploration of
              the graph or to represent text type nodes, to give them understandable labels in the
              language you want, to define a display order for the main entry points, to specify how
              the target nodes of a relationship are displayed, to use existing SKOS vocabularies, etc. If you know HTML, the data
              contained in the graph, the business model used and its implementation, SPARQL and the OWL language,
                <b>you can build and develop your interface independently</b>.</p>
            <p>The aim for the Lab was therefore to achieve <b>a reasonable compromise between the
                complexity of the domain model and the need to produce an understandable and
                efficient interface for users.</b> It took a long time to achieve the current
              result, through successive iterations. Feedback from users during the two workshops
              held at the end of 2021 were invaluable in this respect and really guided both the
              developments of the software and the choices we made.</p>
            <p>The design work of the search interfaces also made it possible to test the features developed as part of the Sparnatural evolution project, including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>the support of the OPTIONAL clause (which facilitates the discovery, as the granularity
                and the accuracy of the data are variable and not determined in advance in a graph of cultural metadata, in
                particular in a archival metadata graph) — we used this possibility for many
                relationships, e.g. ‘has digital surrogate’, ‘has title’, ‘have subject’;</li>
              <li>FILTER NOT EXISTS support (to express the negation of a property) — we also
                retained this possibility in the same cases as for OPTIONAL;</li>
              <li>the ability to select values from a tree list (of type thesaurus) — we used this
                feature to allow selection in the document type thesaurus;</li>
              <li>the ability to add contextual help (<i>tooltips</i>) — this allowed us to attach to each of
                the categories of entities usable in the interface a short definition useful in the
                context of the project;</li>
              <li>the ability to pre-record queries, in order to guide the user in his first queries;</li>
              <li>the ability to choose the result columns to display — this allows the user to define the
                contents of the result list as he wishes, so that he can immediately have textual
                data (rather than only the URIS of entities that a classic SPARQL query returns by
                default), operate sorts and then make an export in CSV format;</li>
              <li>the ability to translate the interface into as many languages as necessary — so far we
                have been able to deploy the search interfaces of the National Archives demonstrator
                in French and English.</li>

            <h3>Results</h3>
            <h4>Warnings</h4>
            <p><b>The demonstrator only consists of two search interfaces and this
              documentation</b>. The National Archives, unlike the BnF (with <a
                href="https://data.bnf.fr">data.bnf.fr</a>), does not have a website for viewing
              data graphs. A feature has therefore been added to the Sparnatural demonstrator, to
              associate with each result entity a page allowing to view its description in a simple
              way (via the <a href="https://lodview.it/">Lodview</a> application). This feature is
              not entirely optimal. Moreover, RDF resources IRIs are not currently dereferencable;
              in particular, no webpage is associated with these IRIs, nor can we guarantee the
              sustainability of the root segment
              (http://data.archives-nationales.culture.gouv.fr/).</p>
            <!--THOMAS ? ajouter notamment qques mots sur les limites techniques actuelles ?(incapacité? de la base RDF à servir plus de 2 requêtes simultanées). Ce problème pourrait être réglé en opérant une migration vers la version Standard de GraphDB.-->
            <p>The results obtained still show some small technical flaws that we will try to correct. Furthermore, <b>we take any comments or suggestions for improvement</b>. We are aware that
              after the user workshops held at the end of 2021, these interfaces need to be tested by
              more users. Just like the RDF queried data, <b>the interfaces are likely to evolve
                significantly</b>.</p>
                <p>The source code of the demonstrator is available in the following repository on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/sparna-git/sparnatural-demonstrateur-an">https://github.com/sparna-git/sparnatural-demonstrateur-an</a>.</p>
            <h4>A Configuration</h4>
            <p>The first configuration (<a href="index-A.html">A interface</a>) is <b>simple and
                generalistic</b>; it can almost be applied to any RiC-O compliant archival dataset,
              insofar as contextual entities such as archival creators, document subject agents, locations
              are indexed. It is a priori rather intended for <b>the discovery of metadata.
              </b>.</p>
            <p>The main categories of objects (classes) defined in the configuration ontology and
              usable in this first interface are:</p>
            <ul>

                  >rico:CorporateBody</a> class);</li>
              <li>Place (which corresponds to <a
                  href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#Place">rico:Place</a> class);</li>
              <li>Documentary form type (class of SKOS concepts defined in the vocabulary of the
                document types of the National Archives, also instances of <a
                  href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#DocumentaryFormType"
                  >rico:DocumentaryFormType</a> class);</li>

                  href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#Thing">rico:Thing</a> class);</li>
              <li>Occupation (class of SKOS concepts defined in the vocabulary of occupations and
                functions of persons in the National Archives, also instances of <a
                  href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#OccupationType"
                  >rico:OccupationType</a> class);</li>
              <li>Digital surrogate (the instances of class <a
                  href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#Instantiation"
                  >rico:Instantiation</a> having JPEG format, generated from the daogrp elements of
                EAD files);</li>
              <li>and other associated ‘entities’, which correspond to literal values of RiC-O datatype 
                properties: date, title, name.</li>

            <h4>B Configuration</h4>
            <p>The second configuration (<a href="index-B.html">B interface</a>) <b>exploits the
                specificities of notarial archives</b>. It is a priori <b>rather adapted to the
                needs of a person familiar with this universe, archivist or accustomed user</b>. This
              is the configuration that has had the greatest number of changes in
              the history of the project. <br />In addition to the categories of objects listed above,
              this configuration defines and uses new categories of objects, and establishes for these
              new categories correspondences with classes of the ontology extending RiC-O mentioned
              above:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Record set (which corresponds to <a
                  href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#RecordSet">rico:RecordSet</a> class),
                Notarial register, List of acts, Notarial act, Mention of an act, Reference Code;</li>
              <li>Notarial office, Notarial office number, Notary;</li>
              <li>Parisian district or parish, Street in Paris, Parisian building, Address.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Most of these entities can be used from the beginning of writing a
              query</b>.</p>
            <p>New relationships are also present, for example between notarial office and notaries
              (Notary <i>is member of</i> Notarial office), between notaries (Notary <i>has
                successor</i> or <i>has family relation with</i> Notary), between archival resources (such as
              Notarial register <i>includes or mentions</i> Mention of an act or List of acts).</p></div></div>

            <h3>The demonstrator as an exploration and research device</h3>
            <p><b>The results are very positive in terms of the possibilities for exploring the
                graph and the new research opportunities offered by Sparnatural</b>. <br /> Among
              the main points identified by users during the November 2021 workshops, once the
              surprise effect has passed, one can mention <b>the intuitive, flexible and interactive
                nature of this type of interface</b>, which also requires a greater intellectual
              commitment for the user than to fill out a classic search form. The user builds <i>his</i>
              questionnaire by choosing among the options available to him and discovers the content
              of the graph at the same time as he constructs his search; he’s really taking over. It is also easy for him to go back by undoing a step, then the previous one.
              Finally, he can share the executed query or export the results of his search.</p>
            <p>We cannot, of course, replace the non-archivist user or the one who does not know the
              RiC-O data model at all. We just want to present here an example of the searches that
              a classic search form in EAD files currently does not allow to do, and which
              Sparnatural makes possible. This example is the same as the third pre-recorded query
              in the B search interface.</p>

              </i>
            </p>
            <p>In this example, we first see that the <b>entry point is a context entity</b>,
              which is currently rare in our archival search interfaces, in which the focus is
              mostly placed at the outset on archival documents. The query editor then allows you to
              choose a category of entity related to document types (here, the choice fell on notarial acts), before going through the graph step by step. The user is still on the same HTML page, and  remains in the context of
              the construction of a questionnaire (without having to work on search
              results in which you would then click on
              hyperlinks, to find out what to expect). He could thus, for example, also be interested in the archival creator of the acts (notary or notarial office). Such a question, even if it is not formulated
              in natural language, seems to us close to the formulation that a researcher in history
              might make of it, who would like, for example, to form a corpus and to get a first
              idea of it. One of the notable features here is also that <b>the user can, for many
                relationships, either select the target precisely, or request all the targets of a
                given relationship</b> (here, all notarial acts, or all dates), at least
                initially.<b> The ability to determine which information is included in the results
                table, and to have textual values (entity labels), not just URIs, in this table, is
                also particularly valuable</b>. Finally, the user can easily modify his questionnaire
              in stages, or <b>share the query and save the link in his own files, in order to
                replay the query later</b>.</p>
            <p><b>The functional limits of the demonstrator are essentially those of
                Sparnatural.</b> The first, already mentioned above, is that it is a tool for
              bulding an exploration and search interface in a knowledge graph, not for displaying
              the data listed in the result tables and consulting them. Moreover, the National Archives does
              not yet have a way to de-reference URIs. The HTML page display feature achieved using Lodview,
              obviously does not replace a real design work of a consultation interface,
              that could also help visualize parts of the obtained graph, in line with what the <a
                href="https://piaaf.demo.logilab.fr/">PIAAF</a> prototype proposed for a much
              smaller amount of data. This was not the purpose of the work done under this
              project.</p>
            <p>Such a search interface is not, moreover, exclusive of a ‘full text’ search allowing,
              from the word or expression entered, to have a list of suggestions giving for each
              of them the type of entity concerned; or tab-type navigation options (one tab per
              entity category) as the PIAAF prototype also offers.</p>
            <p><b>Of course, in addition to these limitations, the dataset used does not provide a homogeneous coverage
                of the archives of the first 40 notarial offices: the
                work of analyzing the notarial acts held within these fonds is continuing at the DMC, as in
                the other fonds</b>.</p>

                  (authority records, vocabularies) to describe the contextual entities of the
                  archives</b>;</li>

                  subset of the RiC-O classes and properties</b>, which is normal since RiC-O is the
                technical transposition of an overall conceptual framework;</li>
              <li>that, <b>while employing only a small part of RiC-O, carrying out such a project

            <h3>A new perspective on the metadata used</h3>
            <p>At this early stage of the work on metadata that the demonstrator allows to explore,
              as we have already mentioned above, <b>thanks to semantic technologies, we have new
                quantitative elements on the content of the described archives</b>. We will be able
              to refine this mapping in the coming months. <br /> Moreover, as in any project for
                <b>the production and publication of graphs of linked entities from pre-existing
                data, where a more or less significant leap is made in precision, the work on the
                data and their exploration as a graph have highlighted problems in the source
                metadata, although not unknown but so far very little visible and difficult to
                quantify</b>. Here we will take two examples.</p>
            <h4>629 246 people in the graph?</h4>
            <p>The essentially free indexing, via the element EAD &lt;persname&gt;, of persons
              (except for 3213 of them with authority records) in the finding aids processed results
              in a very large number of entities of the type rico:Person in the graph, about which
              little is often known (e.g., we know the occupation of 34 925 of these persons only) and which
              have not been the subject of aggregation or identification work. In fact,<b> entities
                with the same name can be aggregated as a single entity Person in this graph only if there is absolute certainty or quasi-certainty that it is the
                same natural person — when, for example, that person is found at about the same
                date, with the reference to the same occupation or function (or the same relations with other
                persons), in the acts of the same notary or mentioning the same property</b>. This
              is a very interesting field of investigation. Regardless of the results, <b>there
                should be a very large cohort of highly blurred individuals whose numbers are not
                expected to differ significantly from the initial number</b>.</p>
            <h4>3135 registers?</h4>
            <p>This number is much higher than the observed reality. It results from the fact that
              in the finding aids treated, there are usually two descriptions (two EAD
              &lt;c&gt;elements between which no relationship is currently established), created in
              two different finding aids, about the same register: one describes the fonds of a given notary, thus its
              registers — and sometimes, references to acts in the registers — and minutes; the
              other, produced as part of the full digitisation of registers, describes the
              notary’s registers as material objects and the lists of acts contained therein. This
              redundancy is not visible enough in the source metadata in the Salle des inventaires virtuelle;
              it is much more so in the RDF graph.</p>
            <p>
              <b>Further analysis has led us to decide to carry out, in the coming months, a test on a
                representative sample of these finding aids, of linking or even merging the
                information they contain, in order to produce, ideally, a single description of each
                of the registers</b>. This example is very representative of other situations,
              related to the long history of the National Archives metadata and the phenomenon of
              stratification of finding aids.</p>

            <h3>Other tangible results of the project</h3>
            <p>The preparation of the RDF data for the Sparnatural demonstrator made it possible to
              carry out a work prior to the update of RiC-O Converter, during which the various
              actions to be undertaken were first identified and coded. This work will save some
              time for the rest. Indeed, we plan to develop a second version of RiC-O Converter to
              make it compatible with version 0.2 of RiC-O.</p>
            <p>The translation into French of the English labels of the RiC-O classes and properties
              used in the graph, carried out during the configuration of the Sparnatural
              demonstrator, will be integrated into the RiC-O sources in order to have a complete
              translation over time.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div  id="conclusion">
            <h2>In conclusion: prospects</h2>
            <p><b>In a possible continuation of the project, it is envisaged that the two
                configurations A and B should be merged into one, by hierarchizing classes and
                properties, to give to the user the choice, within a single search interface, of a
                quick or more precise exploration</b> (e.g. select Person > Notary in a single
              interface). This will involve changing the configuration possibilities offered by
              Sparnatural.</p>
            <p>The Lab of National Archives plans to produce and publish a generic Sparnatural search
              ontology for RiC-O compliant RDF data, starting with configuration A.</p>
            <p>Finally, <b>the National Archives Lab is now able on its own to design a Sparnatural search
                interface for other data sets</b>. The reuse of Sparnatural is therefore
              foreseen in other research projects, for example to explore data from the <a
